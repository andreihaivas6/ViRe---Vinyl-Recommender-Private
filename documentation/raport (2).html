            <p>
                Vire is a system able to "intelligently" recommend
                by exposing a SPARQL endpoint - vinyl music records according to various criteria:
                user preferences (specified via controlled natural language constructs such as "I always
                like/love/prefer classical music, especially opera music by Rossini or Verdi and performed by Angela
                Gheorghiu or Juan Diego Flórez;
                I sometimes like progressive rock and post-rock; I like only metal albums released before 2000;
                I always dislike/hate rap and hip-hop; I dislike songs produced by Flood in the last 25 years"),

                past song purchases on various music stores, playlists - available online via music streaming services:
                Last.fm and alternative solutions and
                locally - for instance, by uploading a JSPF/XSPF document.


                The playlists could be created by the user or shared by her/his virtual "friends" (consider at least one
                social network).
                The system will use several music-related knowledge models and available public resources: Discogs,
                MusicBrainz, Musicmoz Music Styles.

            <h3>2.1. End Users</h3>
            <p>
                The end users of our application are people passionate about music who are looking for vinyl recommandations based on their preferences.
                Additionally, they want to share their musical preferences with friends or they can make a new playlists together. For example, they might combine their playlists for a party so that everyone can listen to music that they both enjoy.

            </p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="use-case">
            <h3>2.2. Use cases description</h3>

            <p>

                Initially, users have the option to either sign up for a new account or log in with an existing one.
                Once logged in, they have the capability to create music playlists,
                import existing ones using a JSPF file,
                or link their last.fm profile.
            </p>
            <p>
                They can also link their account to their music store profile,
                which allows them to add songs they've previously purchased.

                Users also have the opportunity to connect with friends and share their musical tastes, and combine
                their playlists.
                The users can also add description for they musical taste for example adding phrases like: "I sometimes
                like progressive rock and post-rock; I like only metal albums released before 2000; I always
                dislike/hate rap and hip-hop; I dislike songs produced by Flood in the last 25 years".
            </p>
            <p>
                The application's main function is to integrate these features to provide personalized vinyl
                recommendations based on these considerations.

                                <div>This module has the following functionalities:</div>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The recommendation module is divided in two parts: 
                                        <ul>Recommendation for input 
                                            <br/>The user inserts some preferences and the service will recommend vinyls based on those preferences.
                                            For example: I like Queen band. I like rock music. I dislike rap music.
                                            We will parse the sentences into tokens and retain the information like this:
                                            {'likes': {'artist':{'Queen'}, 'genre':{rock}}, dislikes: {'genre':{rap}}}
                                            Then, we will create a query that satisfies all these requests and we will get the vinyls from our <b>Vinyl database</b> and we will recommend them to the user.
                                            Also, we used the spotify API to get similar artists with the ones that the user likes to supliment the recommendation module.
                                        </ul>
                                        <ul>
                                            Recommendation for user
                                            <br/>The user will get recommendations based on his preferences such as:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>his created playlists - </li>
                                                <li>XSPF file</li>
                                                <li>his playlists from Music Streaming apps;</li>
                                                <li>his past purchases from Music Store apps.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            The algorithm works similiar, but with more data about the user history.
                                            We will take in consideration the latest user preferences 
                                            like this: the last day counts the most, then the last week, then the last month and so on.

                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Get recommendations</b> - retrieves recommendations for a specific user, based on his preferences such as:

                                        - as the service will constantly recommend vinyl to the user, we need to reduce the number of requests to the database by storing the preferences in cache.</div>

        <section id="python"><h3>5.1 Python</h3>
            <div>
                Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
                Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library
            </div>
        </section>
        <section id="flask"><h3>5.2 Flask</h3> 
        <div>
            Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.[2] It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.
        </div>

        <section id="react"><h3>5.3 React</h3>
            <div>
                React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.

        <section id="mongodb"><h3>5.4 MongoDB</h3>
            <div>
                MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL) which is considered non-free by some organizations and distributions. MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance.

        <section id="postgres"><h3>5.5 PostgreSQL</h3>
        <div>
            PostgreSQL also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. It was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL.

        <section id="sparql"><h3>5.6 Sparql </h3>
        <div>
            SPARQL (a recursive acronym for SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is an RDF query language—that is, a semantic query language for databases—able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format. It was made a standard by the RDF Data Access Working Group (DAWG) of the World Wide Web Consortium, and is recognized as one of the key technologies of the semantic web.
        </div></section>
        <section id="redis"><h3>5.7 Redis </h3>
        <div>
            Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory key–value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Because it holds all data in memory and because of its design, Redis offers low-latency reads and writes, making it particularly suitable for use cases that require a cache. Redis is the most popular NoSQL database, and one of the most popular databases overall.

        <section id="nlp"><h3>5.8 Controlled natural languages</h3>
        <div>
            Controlled natural languages (CNLs) are subsets of natural languages that are obtained by restricting the grammar and vocabulary in order to reduce or eliminate ambiguity and complexity. Traditionally, controlled languages fall into two major types: those that improve readability for human readers (e.g. non-native speakers), and those that enable reliable automatic semantic analysis of the language.

            To generate recommendations, we require specific data related to users' musical preferences, their
            self-provided preferences, their existing playlists, and their purchased songs from diverse music stores.
        </p>
        <p>
            To gather this necessary data, we'll leverage Last.fm, a music streaming service enabling users to curate
            playlists. Additionally, we'll utilize the Discogs API, a platform providing access to users' past music
            purchases.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also use DBpedia, which provides information about various music-related entities, such as artists,
            albums, genres, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also use The Music Ontology Specification, that provides main concepts and properties for describing
            music (i.e. artists, albums and tracks) on the Semantic Web.

        <h2>7. Linked Data Principles</h2>
        <p>Linked data is a paradigm on the web that relies on existing web technologies, minimizing redundancy,
            facilitating reusability, enabling discovery, maximizing interconnectedness between related 'things,' and
            embracing a pragmatic approach.
            </br> Several key principles define linked data: </p>
        <p>
            1. Use URIs as names for things </br>

            2. Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.</br>

            3. When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)</br>

            4. Include links to other URIs. so that users can discover more things.</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            We maintain these principles by assigning unique HTTP URIs to represent vinyl records, artists, genres, and
            users in the application,
            by using RDF to define metadata and relationships between these entities,
            by employing SPARQL for querying user preferences and by
            establishing links between entities such as vinyls, artists, genres, or songs."
